# Version 2.0 - Complete Admin Removal and Faculty Privilege Transfer

## 🎯 Overview

Version 2.0 represents a major architectural shift in the NBSC Entity Extraction System. This update **completely removes the admin role** and transfers all administrative privileges to the **faculty role**. Faculty members now have full system control, including analytics, user management, and all features previously exclusive to admins.

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### For New Installations

1. **Database Setup:**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   -- Execute: /workspaces/nbsccite-auth/supabase-setup.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   # Deploy to your hosting platform
   ```

3. **Create First Faculty User:**
   - Sign up through the app as "faculty"
   - Verify email
   - Login immediately (no approval needed!)

### For Existing Installations (Upgrading from v1.0)

#### Step 1: Backup Current Database
```sql
-- Backup profiles
CREATE TABLE profiles_backup AS SELECT * FROM public.profiles;

-- Backup pending_approvals
CREATE TABLE pending_approvals_backup AS SELECT * FROM public.pending_approvals;
```

#### Step 2: Run Migration Script
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, execute:
-- /workspaces/nbsccite-auth/version2.0-migration.sql
```

This will:
- ✅ Convert all admin accounts to faculty
- ✅ Activate all pending faculty accounts
- ✅ Update database constraints
- ✅ Create new RLS policies
- ✅ Generate migration summary

#### Step 3: Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check migration results
SELECT * FROM public.v2_migration_summary;

-- Verify no admin roles remain
SELECT COUNT(*) as admin_count 
FROM public.profiles 
WHERE role = 'admin'; -- Should return 0

-- Verify faculty conversion
SELECT role, COUNT(*) 
FROM public.profiles 
GROUP BY role;
```

#### Step 4: Deploy Updated Frontend

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git checkout version2.0
git pull

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Deploy to your platform
# (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

#### Step 5: Clear Browser Cache
```bash
# Inform all users to:
# 1. Clear browser cache
# 2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
# 3. Re-login
```

## 🔧 Rollback Plan (Emergency)

If critical issues arise, follow these steps to rollback:

### Database Rollback
```sql
-- Restore profiles from backup
DELETE FROM public.profiles;
INSERT INTO public.profiles SELECT * FROM profiles_backup;

-- Restore pending_approvals from backup
DELETE FROM public.pending_approvals;
INSERT INTO public.pending_approvals SELECT * FROM pending_approvals_backup;

-- Restore old role constraint
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_role_check;

ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_role_check 
CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'faculty', 'student'));

-- Restore old handle_new_user function
-- (Would need to keep v1.0 version of this function in backup)
```

### Frontend Rollback
```bash
git checkout main  # or your previous stable branch
npm install
npm run build
# Redeploy
```

## 📝 Notes for Developers

### Adding Faculty-Only Features

To add new admin-level features for faculty, ensure:

1. **Database RLS**: Use the pattern:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can manage X" ON public.table_name
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'faculty' AND status = 'active'
    )
  );
```

2. **Frontend Check**: In components:
```typescript
const { user } = useAuth();
if (user?.role !== 'faculty') {
  return <Navigate to="/login" />;
}
```

### Database Schema Constraints

- ⚠️ **Cannot add 'admin' role back** without migration
- ⚠️ Attempting to INSERT with role='admin' will fail
- ⚠️ UPDATE statements trying to set role='admin' will be rejected

### Important File Locations

- Migration script: `/workspaces/nbsccite-auth/version2.0-migration.sql`
- Database setup: `/workspaces/nbsccite-auth/supabase-setup.sql`
- Faculty Dashboard: `/workspaces/nbsccite-auth/src/components/faculty/FacultyDashboard.tsx`
- Admin Redirect: `/workspaces/nbsccite-auth/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- Type definitions: `/workspaces/nbsccite-auth/src/lib/supabase.ts`

## 🎉 Benefits of v2.0

1. **Simplified User Management**: No more approval bottlenecks for faculty
2. **Faster Onboarding**: Faculty can start using the system immediately
3. **Consistent UX**: All users follow email verification flow
4. **Reduced Complexity**: One less role to manage and maintain
5. **Empowered Faculty**: Full system control for academic leadership
6. **Better Scalability**: No single admin bottleneck
7. **Cleaner Codebase**: Less conditional logic for role checks

---

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Faculty user cannot see Analytics tab
- **Solution**: Verify RLS policies were created, check user role is 'faculty', ensure status is 'active'

**Issue**: Old admin account cannot login
- **Solution**: Check if account was converted to faculty in database, verify email confirmation

**Issue**: Database constraint error when creating user
- **Solution**: Ensure migration ran successfully, check role constraint only allows faculty/student

**Issue**: Component import errors after deployment
- **Solution**: Clear build cache (`rm -rf dist/ node_modules/.vite`), reinstall deps, rebuild

### Debug Queries

```sql
-- Check specific user status
SELECT id, email, full_name, role, status 
FROM public.profiles 
WHERE email = 'user@nbsc.edu.ph';

-- List all faculty accounts
SELECT id, email, full_name, status, created_at
FROM public.profiles 
WHERE role = 'faculty'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'pending_approvals');
```
