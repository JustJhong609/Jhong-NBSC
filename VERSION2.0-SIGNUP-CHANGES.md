# Version 2.0 - Faculty Signup Changes

## Overview
In Version 2.0, we've removed the admin approval requirement for faculty accounts. Faculty members can now sign up and have their accounts activated immediately after email verification, just like student accounts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### **Signup.tsx** (`/workspaces/nbsccite-auth/src/pages/Signup.tsx`)
- **Removed:** Yellow warning banner that appeared when selecting "Faculty" role during signup
  - This banner previously stated: "Faculty accounts require administrator approval before you can sign in."
- **Removed:** Conditional success message in the registration modal for faculty
  - Previously showed: "Your account is pending administrator approval. You will receive an email notification once approved."
- **Result:** All users (students and faculty) now see the same message: "Please check your email to verify your account before signing in."

#### **AuthContext.tsx** (`/workspaces/nbsccite-auth/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Removed:** Faculty pending approval check in the `login` function
  - Previously prevented faculty with 'pending' status from logging in
- **Removed:** Faculty-specific logic in the `signup` function
  - Previously threw an error for faculty signups: "Faculty account created successfully. Please wait for administrator approval before signing in."
- **Result:** Faculty accounts follow the same flow as student accounts - email verification only

### 2. Database Changes

#### **supabase-setup.sql** (`/workspaces/nbsccite-auth/supabase-setup.sql`)
- **Modified:** `handle_new_user()` trigger function
  - **Before:** Set faculty status to 'pending', added entry to `pending_approvals` table
  - **After:** All users (including faculty) are set to 'active' status immediately
  - Removed the conditional logic that created entries in the `pending_approvals` table

#### **version2.0-migration.sql** (NEW FILE)
- Created a dedicated migration script for upgrading from v1.0 to v2.0
- **Updates the trigger function** to remove admin approval logic
- **Migrates existing data**: Sets any existing 'pending' faculty accounts to 'active'
- **Cleans up pending approvals**: Marks old pending approvals as 'approved'
- **Adds documentation**: Comments explaining that `pending_approvals` table is deprecated

## How to Deploy

### For New Installations
1. Run the updated `/workspaces/nbsccite-auth/supabase-setup.sql` file in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Deploy the updated frontend code

### For Existing Installations (Upgrading from v1.0)
1. **Run the migration script first:**
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
   /workspaces/nbsccite-auth/version2.0-migration.sql
   ```
   This will:
   - Update the database trigger
   - Activate any pending faculty accounts
   - Mark old approval requests as completed

2. **Deploy the updated frontend code:**
   - Deploy updated `Signup.tsx`
   - Deploy updated `AuthContext.tsx`

## Testing Checklist

After deploying these changes, verify:

- [ ] Faculty can sign up without seeing approval warnings
- [ ] Faculty receive email verification link (same as students)
- [ ] Faculty can log in after email verification
- [ ] Faculty are not blocked by "pending approval" messages
- [ ] Existing faculty accounts (if any were pending) can now log in
- [ ] Student signup still works as expected

## Notes

- The `pending_approvals` table is kept for historical records but is no longer used
- Faculty members will now have immediate access after email verification
- Next steps in v2.0: Transfer admin dashboard features to faculty dashboard (separate task)

## Impact

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Faster onboarding for faculty members
- ✅ Consistent signup experience for all user types
- ✅ No admin bottleneck for faculty account activation

**System Architecture:**
- ✅ Simplified authentication flow
- ✅ Reduced dependency on admin intervention
- ✅ Cleaner codebase with less conditional logic
