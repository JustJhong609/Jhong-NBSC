-- =============================================
-- NBSC CITE Version 2.0 Migration
-- Removes admin role and transfers privileges to faculty
-- Faculty accounts no longer require admin approval
-- =============================================

-- Step 1: Update any existing pending faculty accounts to active status
UPDATE public.profiles
SET status = 'active'
WHERE role = 'faculty' AND status = 'pending';

-- Step 2: Convert all existing admin accounts to faculty role
-- This preserves their data while transferring admin privileges to faculty role
UPDATE public.profiles
SET role = 'faculty', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE role = 'admin';

COMMENT ON UPDATE IS 'v2.0: Converted all admin accounts to faculty role';

-- Step 3: Update the profiles table to remove 'admin' from role constraint
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_role_check;

ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_role_check 
CHECK (role IN ('faculty', 'student'));

COMMENT ON CONSTRAINT profiles_role_check ON public.profiles IS 
'v2.0: Only faculty and student roles are allowed. Admin role has been removed.';

-- Step 4: Update the handle_new_user function to make faculty accounts active by default
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER 
LANGUAGE plpgsql 
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Version 2.0: Faculty accounts are now active by default (no admin approval needed)

  );
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;

COMMENT ON FUNCTION public.handle_new_user IS 
'v2.0: Creates user profiles with active status. Faculty approval removed. Admin role deprecated.';

-- Step 5: Mark pending approvals as approved (they are now obsolete)
UPDATE public.pending_approvals
SET status = 'approved', approved_at = NOW()
WHERE status = 'pending';

COMMENT ON TABLE public.pending_approvals IS 
'Deprecated in v2.0 - Faculty approvals are no longer required. Kept for historical records.';

-- Step 6: Update table comments for documentation
COMMENT ON TABLE public.profiles IS 
'v2.0: Faculty members now have full administrative privileges. Admin role has been removed and converted to faculty.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.profiles.role IS 
'User role: faculty or student. Admin role deprecated in v2.0 (converted to faculty).';

-- Step 7: Optional - Create a view for audit/reporting of the migration

COMMENT ON VIEW public.v2_migration_summary IS

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update all profiles" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all approval requests" ON public.pending_approvals;
